//Quadratic Equation

The standard form of a quadratic equation is:
ax2 + bx + c = 0, where
a, b and c are real numbers and
a ≠ 0

To find the roots of such an equation, we use the formula,
(root1,root2) = (-b ± √b2-4ac)/2

The term b2-4ac is known as the discriminant of a quadratic equation. It tells the nature of the roots.

1. If the discriminant is greater than 0, the roots are real and different.
2. If the discriminant is equal to 0, the roots are real and equal.
3. If the discriminant is less than 0, the roots are complex and different.


//Prime Number

A prime number is a positive integer that is only divisible by 1 and itself. For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 are the first few prime numbers.


//Fibonacci Series

A fibonacci sequence is written as:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...
The Fibonacci sequence is the integer sequence where the first two terms are 0 and 1. After that, the next term is defined as the sum of the previous two terms.
